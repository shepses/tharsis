#   summary: Test bootc rollback functionality
#   duration: 30m
#
# This test verifies bootc rollback functionality:
# 1. Captures the initial deployment state
# 2. Switches to a different image
# 3. Verifies the switch was successful
# 4. Performs bootc rollback
# 5. Reboots and verifies we're back to the original deployment
