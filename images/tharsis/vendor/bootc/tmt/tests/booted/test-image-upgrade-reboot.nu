# This test does:
# bootc image copy-to-storage
# podman build <from that image>
# bootc switch <into that image> (stage only)
# bootc switch --apply <same image> (spec unchanged, must still reboot)
# Verify we boot into the new image
#
# For composefs builds, it additionally verifies that composefs is
# still active after upgrade.  For sealed UKI builds, it checks that
# both the original and upgrade UKIs exist on the ESP.
