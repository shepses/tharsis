#   summary: Execute download-only upgrade tests
#   duration: 40m
#
# This test does:
# bootc image copy-to-storage
# podman build <from that image> (v1)
# bootc switch <into that image>
# Verify we boot into the new image (v1)
# podman build updated image (v2)
# bootc upgrade --download-only (stage v2 in download-only mode)
# reboot (should still boot into v1, staged deployment discarded)
# verify staged deployment is null (discarded on reboot)
# bootc upgrade --download-only (re-stage v2 in download-only mode)
# bootc upgrade --from-downloaded (clear download-only mode without fetching from image source)
# reboot (should boot into v2)
