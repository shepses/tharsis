#   summary: Test building a qcow2 disk image with bootc-image-builder
#   duration: 45m
#   require:
#     - qemu-img
# extra:
#   fixme_skip_if_composefs: true
#
# This test validates that bootc-image-builder (bib) can successfully
# create disk images from the current booted image. This is a critical
# integration test to catch regressions like:
# https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc/issues/1907
#
# The key scenario tested here is a partition layout where /boot is a
# directory on the root filesystem (NOT a separate partition), but
# /boot/efi IS a separate mount point. The bug was that when bootc
# checked /boot, it found "efi" as a directory entry and failed to
# recognize it was actually a mount point on a different device.

    #    and /boot/efi is a mount point
