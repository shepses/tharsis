#   summary: Test bootc loader-entries set-options-for-source
#   duration: 30m
#
# This test verifies the source-tracked kernel argument management via
# bootc loader-entries set-options-for-source. It covers:
# 1. Input validation (invalid/empty source names)
# 2. Adding source-tracked kargs and verifying they appear in /proc/cmdline
# 3. Kargs and x-options-source-* BLS keys surviving the staging roundtrip
# 4. Source replacement semantics (old kargs removed, new ones added)
# 5. Multiple sources coexisting independently
# 6. Source removal (--source without --options clears all owned kargs)
# 7. Idempotent operation (no changes when kargs already match)
# 8. Existing system kargs (root=, ostree=, etc.) preserved through changes
# 9. --options "" (empty string) clears kargs without removing the source
# 10. Staged deployment interaction (bootc switch + set-options-for-source
#     preserves the pending image switch)
#
# Requires ostree with bootconfig-extra support (>= 2026.1).
# See: https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree/pull/3570
# See: https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc/issues/899
